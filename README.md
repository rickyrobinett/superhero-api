=============
Beginnings of basic REST API using node.js we built at Columbia ADI meetup on 10/22/2013. Want to make improvements? Just submit a pull request!

Setup
-------------
Clone project to desired location and run:
```
npm install
```

Then start the app by running:
```
node app.js
```

You can then take the following actions on heroes resources:
* GET /heroes : Get all heroes.
* GET /heroes/:id : Get hero with specific id
* POST /heroes : Create new hero. Pass name data in POST request.
* PUT /heroes/:id : Update or create hero with specific id
* DELETE /heroes/:id : Delete hero with specific id
